# The Godfather's Guide to Travel Package Booking

Welcome to the family, where booking travel packages is a piece of cannoli! This Laravel-powered system is your ticket to a world of seamless travel arrangements. Agents, customers—gather 'round and let me tell you about the features of this digital cosa nostra.

## Features

- **User Authentication:**
  - Simple registration and login functionality that even Luca Brasi would find easy to use.

- **Dashboard (For Agents):**
  - Add new travel packages, like plotting the perfect heist—complete with destination, price, duration, and a brief description.
  - Edit and delete existing packages, just like making someone an offer they can't refuse.
  - View a list of all bookings made by customers, because information is power.

- **Travel Package Display (For Customers):**
  - View available travel packages, a menu of options better than Mama Corleone's Sunday sauce.
  - Search for packages based on destination, because sometimes you need to be specific about your "business trips."
  - Book a package with the finesse of a consigliere, providing necessary details (name, contact, and travel date).

- **UI Enhancements:**
  - Use JavaScript to enhance the user experience, making it smoother than a well-oiled Tommy gun.
  - Implement basic responsive design for mobile views, because even wise guys need to book on the go.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up your own digital empire on your local machine for development and testing purposes. You'll need PHP, Composer, Laravel CLI, a database, and a web server—just like building your own Corleone compound.

7. **Run seeders:**

   ```

9. **Start the development server:**
